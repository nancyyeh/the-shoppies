# 💭 Design Decisions

- Since OMDB also only has 1,000 daily limit, I added a debounce on the search query so there is a delay in search query when the user is typing. Solves: overloading the OMDB database / hitting daily limits
- Use Material-UI library to make it look clean, simple, modern, and responsive!
- Responsive design to display search results and nomination list
  - Wide Screen(desktop): 2 column grid layout - Search Results 2/3 of screen, nomination list 1/3 of screen.

    - Nomination list is sticked to top while scrolling.

  - Narrow Screen(mobile): 1 column stacked layout - Search results will turn from card view into listed view when width is < 600px.

- Display movie poster returned from OMDB as avator. If no poster is returned from OMDB, a generic movie icon is displayed for list view, and blank placeholder is displayed for card view.
- Use pagination to show more research results.
- Use local storage to save nominated movies.
